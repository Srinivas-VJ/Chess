### How to play
* Each position on the board is representated by a row number from 1 to 8 and a column alphabhet from 'a' to 'h'.
* The player can enter the move by typing:-
  - The column alphabhet and the row number of the pawn they want ot move followed by the column alphabhet and the row number of 
    the position they want their pawn to move to.
  - For example **a2a4** will move the pawn at column 'a', row 2 to position column 'a', row 4.
  - spaces inbetween or capital letters are not accepted.
  - the player can enter 'r' or 'R' to resign at any stage of the game.
