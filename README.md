* A two player chess game.
* Can be played from the terminal.

### Rules
The player controlling the white pieces is named "White", the player controlling the black pieces is named "Black". White moves first, then players alternate moves. Making a move is required, it is not legal to skip a move, even when having to move is detrimental. Play continues until a king is checkmated, or a draw is declared due to 50 inactive move rule.

### How to play
* Each position on the board is representated by a row number from 1 to 8 and a column alphabhet from 'a' to 'h'.
* The player can enter the move by typing:-
  - The column alphabhet and the row number of the pawn they want ot move followed by the column alphabhet and the row number of 
    the position they want their pawn to move to.
  - For example **a2a4** will move the pawn at column 'a', row 2 to position column 'a', row 4.
  - spaces inbetween or capital letters are not accepted.
